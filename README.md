# Keep in Touch
In the project work a progressive web application for Android and IOS was created, which allows users to share text-based content with a contact list. The app contains a registration and a login, but no unnecessary sensitive data is required. All stored data is managed via a REST-Api in connection with a MySQL database. As a registered user I can write and share text messages. Users can be found via a username and can be added to a friends list and removed later. All people who are in the app's own contact list can view and read content from me. 

For the app we will develop a user-friendly Ionic frontend, which is especially designed for mobile users. It will be extended by a backend for data management. The backend will be realized via the framework Spring Boot, which runs in a docker container environment and manages the user generated data via a MySQL database.

The application was implemented as part of the master's degree "Informatik" at Hochschule Kaiserslautern - University of Applied Sciences, Campus Zweibrücken.
